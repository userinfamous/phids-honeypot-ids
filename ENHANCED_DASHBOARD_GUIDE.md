## üóëÔ∏è **Clear Logs Functionality**

### **Purpose**
Remove test/demo data to monitor only real attack attempts against your network.

### **How to Use**
1. **Access**: Click `Controls` ‚Üí `Clear Logs` in the navigation bar
2. **Choose Type**:
   - **All Logs** - Clear both connections and alerts (recommended for fresh start)
   - **Connections Only** - Keep alerts, clear honeypot connections
   - **Alerts Only** - Keep connections, clear IDS alerts
3. **Confirm**: Click "Clear Logs" to execute (irreversible action)

### **When to Use**
- **Before Production**: Clear demo data before deploying to monitor real threats
- **Regular Maintenance**: Periodic cleanup of old logs
- **Testing Cycles**: Reset between different testing scenarios
- **Demonstration Prep**: Clear old data before live demos

## üéØ **Real-World Usage Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Production Deployment**
```bash
# 1. Clear demo data
# Use dashboard: Controls ‚Üí Clear Logs ‚Üí All Logs

# 2. Deploy to production network
python main.py --debug

# 3. Monitor real attacks
# Dashboard shows only genuine threats
```

### **Scenario 2: Incident Investigation**
```bash
# 1. Filter by suspicious IP
# Filters: IP Address = "192.168.1.100"

# 2. Set time range to incident window
# Filters: Time Range = Custom (incident timeframe)

# 3. Export for analysis
# Controls ‚Üí Export Connections (CSV)
```

### **Scenario 3: Threat Analysis**
```bash
# 1. Filter high-severity alerts
# Filters: Severity = "High"

# 2. Focus on specific attack type
# Filters: Alert Type = "SQL Injection"

# 3. Export for reporting
# Controls ‚Üí Export Alerts (CSV)
```

### **Scenario 4: Service-Specific Analysis**
```bash
# 1. Filter by service type
# Filters: Service = "SSH"

# 2. Analyze SSH-specific attacks
# Review patterns and frequencies

# 3. Compare with HTTP attacks
# Change filter to Service = "HTTP"
```
