## üîê **Admin Authentication Testing**

### **Test Credentials for Honeypot Verification**

PHIDS includes intentionally weak admin credentials to simulate vulnerable systems for educational purposes. These credentials are designed to allow attackers to think they've gained access while being monitored.

#### **Working Admin Credentials (Intentionally Weak)**
```
Username: admin     | Password: admin
Username: admin     | Password: password
Username: admin     | Password: 123456
Username: root      | Password: root
Username: administrator | Password: admin
Username: test      | Password: test
Username: guest     | Password: guest
Username: demo      | Password: demo
```

#### **Manual Testing Instructions**

**1. Access Admin Login Page**
```bash
# Open browser or use curl
curl http://127.0.0.1:8081/admin
# Expected: HTML login form with username/password fields
```

**2. Test Successful Login (Weak Credentials)**
```bash
# Using curl to test admin:admin
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8081/admin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=admin&password=admin"

# Expected Response: Fake admin dashboard with:
# - Welcome message: "Successfully logged in as: admin"
# - Fake system status (Server: Online, Database: Connected)
# - Fake admin links (Manage Users, System Settings, etc.)
# - Honeypot disclaimer note
```

**3. Test Failed Login (Strong Credentials)**
```bash
# Using curl to test strong credentials
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8081/admin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=admin&password=StrongPassword123!"

# Expected Response: Login failure page with:
# - "Authentication Failed" message
# - Attempted credentials display (password masked)
# - "Try again" link
```

**4. Verify Database Logging**
```bash
# Check that login attempts are logged
python -c "
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('data/phids.db')
cursor = conn.execute('SELECT * FROM honeypot_connections ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 5')
for row in cursor.fetchall():
    print(f'Connection: {row[2]}:{row[3]} -> {row[5]} at {row[7]}')
conn.close()
"
# Expected: Recent admin login attempts logged with timestamps
```

#### **What Each Test Demonstrates**

- **Weak Credentials Success**: Shows honeypot's intentional vulnerability simulation
- **Strong Credentials Failure**: Demonstrates realistic security behavior
- **Complete Logging**: Proves all attempts are captured for forensic analysis
- **Attack Success Tracking**: Verifies the system can distinguish successful vs failed attacks

#### **Educational Purpose**

These weak credentials serve important educational functions:
- **Demonstrate Attack Vectors**: Show how weak passwords enable unauthorized access
- **Simulate Real Vulnerabilities**: Provide realistic attack scenarios for training
- **Enable Monitoring**: Allow security analysts to observe post-authentication attacker behavior
- **Support Research**: Facilitate cybersecurity education and threat analysis

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: These credentials are intentionally weak for educational purposes only. Never use such credentials in production systems.

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

#### **"No attacks appearing in dashboard"**
```bash
# 1. Verify PHIDS is running
python main.py --debug
# Expected output: "SSH Honeypot started on port 2222", "HTTP Honeypot started on port 8081"

# 2. Test dashboard API connectivity
curl http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/stats
# Expected: JSON response with statistics

# 3. Verify ports are listening
netstat -an | grep ":2222\|:8081\|:5001"
# Expected: LISTENING status for all three ports

# 4. Test honeypot responsiveness
curl http://127.0.0.1:8081/test
# Expected: Response from HTTP honeypot + dashboard entry within 2 seconds
```

#### **"Dashboard shows old timestamps"**
```bash
# Check system time synchronization
date  # Linux/Mac
Get-Date  # Windows PowerShell

# Verify database timestamp format
sqlite3 data/phids.db "SELECT timestamp FROM honeypot_connections ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;"
# Expected: ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS)

# Clear cache and refresh
# Browser: Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R
```

#### **"Real-time updates not working"**
```bash
# Check WebSocket connection in browser console (F12)
# Expected: WebSocket connection to ws://127.0.0.1:5000/ws

# Verify WebSocket configuration
grep -r "websocket_update_interval" config.py
# Expected: 5 seconds (configurable)

# Test WebSocket manually
python -c "
import asyncio
import websockets
async def test():
    async with websockets.connect('ws://127.0.0.1:5000/ws') as ws:
        msg = await ws.recv()
        print('Received:', msg)
asyncio.run(test())
"
```

#### **"Permission denied errors"**
```bash
# Linux/Mac: Run with appropriate privileges
sudo python main.py

# Windows: Run PowerShell as Administrator
# Right-click PowerShell ‚Üí "Run as Administrator"

# Alternative: Use Docker (no privilege issues)
docker-compose up
```

#### **"High CPU/Memory usage"**
```bash
# Check performance configuration
grep -A 10 "performance" config.py

# Recommended settings for production:
# - websocket_update_interval: 10 (seconds)
# - stats_cache_duration: 60 (seconds)
# - max_websocket_connections: 10

# Monitor resource usage
top -p $(pgrep -f "python main.py")  # Linux
Get-Process python | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -eq "python"}  # Windows
```
